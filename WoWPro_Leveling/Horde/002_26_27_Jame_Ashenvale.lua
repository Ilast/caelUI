K Kill Sharptalon for Sharptalon's Claw |QID|2|L|16305|N| Sharptalon: It is unlikely you will be able to kill Sharptalon at your present level. Once you spot Sharptalon, keep him in sight and wait till he is close enough to the Forsaken Camp. Next, pull him with the lowest aggro spell/shot you have (a simple bow shoot, or rank 1 nuke).  Bring him to the Forsaken Camp. DO NOTHING.  Let the NPCs aggro it and take it off you. Once they have Sharptalon down to 90%, start attacking again, you must do as much damage as possible, but don't use high aggro spells.  Help them finish it off, then loot Sharptalon's Claw|M|75,71|
