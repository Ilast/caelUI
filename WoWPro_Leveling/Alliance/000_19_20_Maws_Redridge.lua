N Grinding Session |QID|92| |N|In order to be able to continue on Boston's Leveling Guide 20-30, I'll have to put a little grinding in here. I don't like doing this myself, but sadly, all the Redridge Mountain quests I use to do at level 19, Boston does at level 20. So therefore, you'll have to grind this last part. This is actually faster than going to another region and doing quests there. Grind on Kobolds until you are 1350 XP  away from dinging, and then close this step. (30.00, 83.59)|M|5%,|
